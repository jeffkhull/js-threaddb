        "Now we’re ready to start working against the remote. The first thing you’ll likely want to do, is initialize a new database on the remote. This is essentially allocating a new Thread, and pushing the local schema information to the remote database. In practice, you’ll likely want to do this the first time a user connects with the remote daemon, and only then. But ThreadDB makes this operation pretty much idempotent, so if you accidentally try to initialize twice, you shouldn’t end up with more than one database on the remote. We’ll be working further to make this easier, so that it will detect version changes and things like that to handle schema changes “on the fly”."
